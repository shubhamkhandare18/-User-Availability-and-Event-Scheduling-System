Dynamic User Availability and Event Scheduling System

It is Dynamic User Availability and Event Scheduling System demonstrated using Full Stack Development .

OVERVIEW
The Dynamic User Availability and Event Scheduling System is a full-stack web application that allows users to set their availability dynamically and enables admins to schedule sessions. Built with the MERN stack, it features a React frontend, an Express backend, and a MongoDB database. The application supports one-on-one and multi-participant sessions with a user-friendly interface.
To develop a system that efficiently manages and schedules events based on user availability, leveraging modern frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

Frontend:

Framework/Library: ReactJS
Purpose: Build an interactive and responsive user interface.
Features:
Real-time updates of user availability and event schedules.
Dynamic forms for event creation and user availability input.
Calendar views and scheduling interfaces for better usability.
Integration with backend APIs for data retrieval and updates.



Certainly! It sounds like your assessment is focused on a Dynamic User Availability and Event Scheduling System that utilizes both frontend and backend technologies, with ReactJS specifically mentioned for the frontend. Hereâ€™s a summary:

Dynamic User Availability and Event Scheduling System
Objective:
To develop a system that efficiently manages and schedules events based on user availability, leveraging modern frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

Frontend:
